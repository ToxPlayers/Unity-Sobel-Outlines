# Usage

Add "Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature" to your Universal Renderer Data.<br>
Requirements must have "Depth" and "Normal" enabled.<br>
Set the material to the Outlines material with the outlines shader.<br>

# Parameters  
<h1> IMPORTANT: when testing with scene view camera, make sure the near and far values in the top camera settings are the same as your game's camera.</h1>
  
**Scale -** the distance of the pixel sampling. Values other than 1 may introduce visual artifacts.<br> 
**NearNormalThreshold -** the normal threshold when the camera is at 0 distance.<br> 
**FarNormalThreshold -** the normal threshold when the camera is at **MaxFadeDistance** distance.<br>
**NearDepthThreshold -** the depth threshold when '''.<br>
**FarDepthThreshold -** the depth threshold when '''.<br>
**MinFadeDistance -** the minimum distance for the fade to begin.<br>
**MaxFadeDistance -** the maximum distance for the outline to be visible. pixels farther than **MaxFadeDistance** will not be sampled.<br>
**Angle -** An angle for multiplying the depth outline to avoid artifacts when the viewing angle is nearly perpendicular.<br>
**AngleMultiplier -** When reaching **Angle**, depth outline will be multiplied by this value.<br>
